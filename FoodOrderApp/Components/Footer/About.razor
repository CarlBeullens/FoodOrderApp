    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p class="story">Blazing Burgers started as a food truck in Belgium. 
        Our signature flame-grilled technique and locally-sourced ingredients quickly earned us a loyal following. 
        Today, we're proud to serve our community with the same dedication to quality and innovation that sparked our journey.
